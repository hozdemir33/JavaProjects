/*
It’s Your Turn
Another example of nested iteration with string variables is frequency analysis. In frequency analysis, you analyze a message by how often the most common letters (like E and T) occur in the message. This is a useful tool in cybersecurity, particularly in the field of cryptography.

Your task is to write a program, LetterFrequencies, that prints each letter of the alphabet and the number of times that letter occurs in the phrase. To complete this task, you will need to incorporate the following constructs.

Loop to iterate through the alphabet (the outer loop)
Loop to iterate through all the letters of a phrase (the inner loop)
Counter variable to count the number of times a letter is in the phrase
Print statement to display the frequencies/*

HIDE ---

Create the outer loop first and make sure it works, then create the inner loop.
You can use the substring method to get individual letters.
If you’re using a while loop, don’t forget to increment!
You will need an if statement to check if values are equal in order to add to the counter.
Don’t forget to reset the counter after each iteration.
